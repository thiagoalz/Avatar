Distributed two phase commit simulation program.

*Concurrency control (primary copy)
*Really distributed operation
*Configurable for N servers

The program is based on a fully connected topology, but the control algorithm allows it to use another one!
The primary copy can be numbered, so if a site goes down, it gets te next primary copy.
